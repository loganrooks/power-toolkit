# previously carried SEPARATE lists and they drifted: the CPU path's `KILL_ALLOWLIST` omitted
# claude/codex/cmux, Finder and com.apple.Virtualization, all of which §4 names as untouchable
# and all of which the memory path already protected. Consequence: in `aggressive` mode
# (AUTO_KILL=1) the cpu-watchdog would SIGTERM a sustained-hot LIVE Claude Code session — a
# shipped §4 violation. Found by cross-vendor review 2026-07-26 (review-journal/0001, F4; E-025).

# ---------- aggregate ("distributed runaway") gate ----------
# The per-process gate above is structurally blind to MANY small hogs that each stay under

# load 142 on 10 cores, 0.0% idle for ~9h — and every one was filtered out at line `cpu >=
# CPU_THRESHOLD`, so zero alerts fired. This gate watches the SYSTEM, not any single process.
# DETECTION-ONLY BY DESIGN: an aggregate signal cannot attribute blame (36 orphans and a
# legitimate `make -j16` share a load signature), so it must never kill. Attributed-kill is a
# separate, profile-classified design — see goal/briefs/0002 and GOAL_CONTRACT §4 (notify-first).
